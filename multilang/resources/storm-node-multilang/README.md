# storm-node-multilang

An implementation of the multi-language support for [Storm][0] in **node.js**

## Example Usage

### Spout creation

```javascript
	
	var Spout = require('storm-node-multilang').Spout;

	//The Spout constructor takes a definition function,
	//an input stream and an output stream
    var sentenceEmitter = new Spout(function(events) {
		var collector = null;
		var seqId = 1;

		//You can listen to the spout "open", "ack" and "fail" events to
		events.on('open', function(c) {
			collector = c;
		});

		events.on('ack', function(messageId) {
			console.log(messageId + ' acked');
		});

		events.on('fail', function(messageId) {
			console.log(messageId + ' failed');
		});

		//The definition function must return a function used as
		//the nextTuple function.
		return function(cb) {
			
			collector.emit(["hello"], seqId++);
			cb();

		}

	}, process.stdin, process.stdout);

	
	process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
	process.stdin.resume();
    
``` 


### Bolt creation

```javascript
	
	var Bolt = require('storm-node-multilang').Bolt;

	//The Bolt constructor takes a definition function,
	//an input stream and an output stream
    var joinBolt = new Bolt(function(events) {
		var collector = null;

		//You can listen to the bolt "prepare" event to
		//fetch a reference to the OutputCollector instance
		events.on('prepare', function(c) {
			collector = c;
		});

		//The definition function must return a function used as
		//the execute function.
		return function(tuple, cb) {
		
			collector.emit(tuple.values.join(', '));
			collector.ack(tuple);
			cb();
		}

	}, process.stdin, process.stdout);

	process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
	process.stdin.resume();
    
``` 

## How to test my node.js spouts and bolts with Storm ?

To test your node.js spouts and bolts you will need to setup a storm cluster 
which is very painful if you don't want to run VM and a Zookeeper cluster.  

Storm provides a `LocalCluster` class to test a topology locally.  

Maybe the easiest way to test your topologies is to use our [storm-local-multilang][1] project.


## Installation

    $ npm install storm-node-multilang

## Running Tests

To run the test suite first invoke the following command within the repo, installing the development dependencies:

    $ npm install

then run the tests (require `mocha`) :

    $ npm test
